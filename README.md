# portfolio

* As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
* As the creator, I want the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
* As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.

* As a visitor, I want the site to be responsive, so that I can read it on any device.
* As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest projects on top so that I can easily see the developers recent work.
